# realestate

**realestate** is a Go educational project inspired by Brad Traversy's Django [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/) "Python Django Dev to Deployment."


The main aim of building this project is to practice web development in Go by creating an application backed by [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org). Along the way, learn Go templates and database migrations, build Docker environments, use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) web server and deploy the project to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
