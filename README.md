# realestate

**realestate** is a Go educational project inspired by Brad Traversy's Django [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-dev-to-deployment/) "Python Django Dev to Deployment."

The project's primary goal is to practice web development in Go by creating an application backed by [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org).
